Following the [official guidelines](https://www.fate-go.jp/guidelines/), my current SNS icon features Abigail Williams, also known as Abby-chan, from "Fate/Grand Order". This artwork was beautifully crafted by [SAIPACo.-san](https://skeb.jp/@saipaco/works/5).

I greatly enjoy engaging with my online community through [SNS]({% link _pages/sns.md %}).
