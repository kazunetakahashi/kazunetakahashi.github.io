# Solutions

## [A - Blackjack](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc147/tasks/abc147_a)

### Solution

Determine whether $A + B + C \geq 22$ or not.

### Implement

I noticed that I should not have done by `vector<int> A(3)`. We just use `int A, B, C;`. It is faster in terms of writing codes.

## [B - Palindrome-philia](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc147/tasks/abc147_b)

Let $N$ be the size of $S$. For $0 \leq i < N / 2$, determine $S[i] = S[N - 1 - i]$ or not. If not, we increment the counter. The answer is the count of it.

## [C - HonestOrUnkind2](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc147/tasks/abc147_c)

### Solution

Try all possibilities. The time complexity is $O(N ^ 2 2 ^ N)$.

### Caution

Be careful that, in this problem, the unkind people do not necessarily tells us wrong things. We check only honest people's statements.

## [D - Xor Sum 4](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc147/tasks/abc147_d)

### Solution

We calculate
\\[
  S = \sum _ {0 \leq i < j < N} A _ i \oplus A _ j
\\]
for each binary place. For $k = 0, \dots, 59$, we can calculate as follows.
\\[
  S _ k = \sum _ {0 \leq i < j < N} A _ {ik} \oplus A _ {jk} = N _ o N _ e 2 ^ k,
\\]
where $N _ o$ or $N _ e$ is the number of odd or even elements, respectively.

## [E - Balanced Path](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc147/tasks/abc147_e)

### Observation

We focus on the absolute value of the difference. Thus we see the following fact.

- The two numbers on each grid is not needed. Just possess the absolute value of difference: $G[i][j]$.
- If we fix a pass on which the numbers are $a _ 0, a _ 1, \dots, a _ K$, we can compute the answer by DP.

We can solve this problem if we fix the pass and we can convert the grid-type original problem into DP by the same idea.

### DP part

#### Definition

> $dp[i][j][k] = $ `true` or `false`: Whether we can achieve the absolute value of the difference being $k$ on the point $(i, j)$.

#### Initial state

$dp[0][0][G[0][0]] = $ `true`; otherwise `false`.

#### Answer

$\min \\{ k \geq 0 \mid dp[H - 1][W - 1][k] \\}$.

#### Transition

For $i = 0, \dots, H - 1$, for $j = 0, \dots, W - 1$,

- If $i + 1 < H$, we can take a tour $(i, j) \mapsto (i + 1, j)$. For $k = 0, \dots, C$, if $dp[i][j][k]$ is `true`, $dp[i + 1][j][\lvert k \pm G[i + 1][j] \rvert] \gets$ `true`.
- If $j + 1 < W$, we can take a tour $(i, j) \mapsto (i, j + 1)$. For $k = 0, \dots, C$, if $dp[i][j][k]$ is `true`, $dp[i][j + 1][\lvert k \pm G[i][j + 1] \rvert] \gets$ `true`.

### How to use `bitset`

If we are allowed double-count of $\pm c$, we can use `bitset`. Shift operation is critical.

```c++
  vector<vector<bitset<C>>> DP(H, vector<bitset<C>>(W, 0));
  DP[0][0][G[0][0] + D] = 1;
  for (auto i = 0; i < H; ++i)
  {
    for (auto j = 0; j < W; ++j)
    {
      if (i + 1 < H)
      {
        DP[i + 1][j] |= DP[i][j] << G[i + 1][j];
        DP[i + 1][j] |= DP[i][j] >> G[i + 1][j];
      }
      if (j + 1 < W)
      {
        DP[i][j + 1] |= DP[i][j] << G[i][j + 1];
        DP[i][j + 1] |= DP[i][j] >> G[i][j + 1];
      }
    }
  }
```

## [F - Sum Difference](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc147/tasks/abc147_f)

### Initial step

Let $U$ be the sum of the all $a _ i$. Then, $S - T = S - (U - S) = 2S - U$. Here $U$ is fixed. Thus we can count how many possibilities $S$ can achieve.

If $d = 0$ and $x = 0$, the answer is $1$. If $d = 0$ and $x \neq 0$, the answer is $N + 1$. Hereinafter we assume $d > 0$ since if $d < 0$, we can continue solving this problem converting $x \gets -x$ and $d \gets -d$.

We can write the $i$-th element as $x + di$.

### Observation

We try all $0 \leq k \leq N$, where $k$ is the number of the elements taken by $S$.

Then, $S$ is calculated as follows.
\\[
  S = k x + d \sum _ {i \colon k \text{ elements}} i.
\\]

Here, $\sum$-part will achieve its minimum
\\[
  L = 0 + 1 + \dots + (k - 1) = \frac{(k - 1)k}{2},
\\]
and its maximum
\\[
  R = (N - 1) + (N - 2) + \dots + (N - k) = kN + \frac{(k + 1)k}{2}.
\\]
Note that $\sum$-part runs on all $[L, R]$. Therefore, the all possibilities of $S$ is described as follows.
\\[
  S _ k = \\{ kx + dX \in \mathbb{Z} \mid L \leq X \leq R \\}. \tag{F.1}
\\]
We want to concat all the $S _ k$. How can we do that?

### Solution

We convert it into the range-concat problem split into $D$ columns. Let $r = (kx) \% d$ and $m = (kx - r)/d$. Note that, in C++, if $x < 0$, the normal operation of $\%$ results in $r < 0$. Make sure that $0 \leq r < d$; if $r < 0$, we have $r \mathbin{ {+} {=} } d;$. Therefore we can regard (F.1) is as **the range $[m + L, m + R + 1)$ on the $r$-th quotient space**.

More precisely, let f \colon \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z} / d \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ be defined as follows.
\\[
  f(n) = (n \% d, n / d).
\\]
Then, we see that $f$ is bijection. In addition, we have
\\[
  f( S _ k ) = \{ r \} \times [m + L, m + R + 1).
\\]
where $r$, $m$, $L$ and $R$ are defined as above.

Therefore, the concat operation is done by simple task-scheduling problem by using `map<ll, vector<Schedule>> M;`. To insert $S _ k$, we push $M[r] \gets [m + L, m + R + 1)$. Here we define `using Schedule = tuple<ll, bool>;` and `push_back` two elements for each interval.
