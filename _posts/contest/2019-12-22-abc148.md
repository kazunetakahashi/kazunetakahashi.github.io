# Solutions

## [A - Round One](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc148/tasks/abc148_a)

Flush $6 - A - B$.

## [B - Strings with the Same Length](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc148/tasks/abc148_b)

Just do as they indicate us to.

## [C - Snack](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc148/tasks/abc148_c)

Flush $\mathrm{lcm}(A, B)$.

## [D - Brick Break](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc148/tasks/abc148_d)

We can compute the maximum of the remaining bricks by greedy algorithm.

## [E - Double Factorial](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc148/tasks/abc148_e)

### Solution

Let

> $g(n, p) = $ how many times $n$ can be divided by $p$.

The answer is
\\[
  g(n!!, 10) = \min(g(n!!, 2), g(n!!, 5)).
\\]
If $n$ is odd, it immediately follows that $g(n!!, 2) = 0$. Hence the answer is zero. Hereinafter we assume that $n$ is even. We see that
\\[
  \begin{align}
    n!! &= n \cdot (n - 2) \cdot \dots \cdot 4 \cdot 2, \\\\\
    \frac{n}{2}! &= \frac{n}{2} \cdot \left( \frac{n}{2} - 1 \right) \cdot \dots \cdot 2 \cdot 1.
  \end{align}
\\]
Therefore we see that
\\[
  \begin{align}
    g(n!!, 2) &= g\left( \frac{n}{2}!, 2 \right) + \frac{n}{2}, \\\\\
    g(n!!, 5) &= g\left( \frac{n}{2}!, 5 \right).
  \end{align}
\\]
In addition, it follows that
\\[
  g(n!, p) = \frac{n}{p} + g\left( \frac{n}{p}!, p \right) + \frac{n}{p}.
\\]
And it stops by $g(0, p) = 0$.

### Another Solution

Just count how many $5$s $N!!$ has as factors. This is done directly as follows.

```c++
  if (N & 1)
  {
    cout << 0 << endl;
    return 0;
  }
  ll M{N};
  ll five{0};
  while (M >= 5)
  {
    five += M / 10;
    M /= 5;
  }
  cout << five << endl;
```

## [F - Playing Tag on Tree](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc148/tasks/abc148_f)

### Solution

First of all, **Takahashi-kun and Aoki-kun can't pass each other**. Therefore, Takahashi-kun cannot reach the vertex $x$ where $\mathrm{dist} _ T(x) \geq \mathrm{dist} _ A (x)$. Of course the vertexes on Aoki-kun's side won't be reached by Takahashi-kun. Otherwise, let $y$ be the intersection point of Takahashi and Aoki on the pass from the initial vertexes. We have $\mathrm{dist} _ T(y) \geq \mathrm{dist} _ A (y)$, which means Aoki-kun can capture Takahashi-kun as long as he wants to reach $x$. On the contrary, Takahashi-kun can reach $x$ where $\mathrm{dist} _ T(x) < \mathrm{dist} _ A (x)$.

In addition, we see that, if Takahashi-kun reaches $x$, Aoki-kun will take $\mathrm{dist} _ A (x) - 1$ turns to capture him. Note that $-1$ means that Takahashi-kun will be captured in front of $x$. Therefore we can achieve
\\[
  \max _ {x \colon \mathrm{dist} _ T(x) < \mathrm{dist} _ A (x)} \mathrm{dist} _ A (x) - 1.
\\]
In addition, this is the maximum value since Aoki-kun cannot reach each vertex $x$ by less than $\mathrm{dist} _ A (x)$ turns.
