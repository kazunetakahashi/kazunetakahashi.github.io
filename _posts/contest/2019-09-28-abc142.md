# Solutions

## [A - Odds of Oddness](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc142/tasks/abc142_a)

Just calculate by `for`-loop.

Or let $M = (N + 1) / 2$. Then flush $M / N$, casting them into `double`.

## [B - Roller Coaster](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc142/tasks/abc142_b)

Just calculate by `for`-loop, too.

## [C - Go to School](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc142/tasks/abc142_c)

### Solution #1

We use `vector<tuple<int, int>> V;`. We insert $(A _ i, i)$ into $V$ and sort it.

### Solution #2

Assume $0$-indexed.

Let $X[i]$ be the $i$-th person who came to the school. Then, it holds that $X[A _ i - 1] = i$. Flush $X$ in the ascending order.

## [D - Disjoint Set of Common Divisors](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc142/tasks/abc142_d)

Let $M = \mathrm{lcm}(A, B)$. Count the prime factors by your library.

```c++
  ll A, B;
  cin >> A >> B;
  Sieve sieve;
  auto V{sieve.factor(gcd(A, B))};
  cout << V.size() + 1 << endl;
```

## [E - Get Everything](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc142/tasks/abc142_e)

### Solution

This is done by bit-DP.

#### Definition

For $c \in \mathcal{P}(N)$, we define $DP[c]$ as follows.

> $DP[c] = $ the minimum cost to buy a set of keys that enable us to unlock all the box $b \in c$.

#### Answer

Flush $DP[2 ^ N - 1]$ if it is not $\infty$, otherwise flush `-1`.

#### Initial State

$DP[0] = 0$, otherwise $\infty$.

#### Transition

For all $(a, k)$, for all $j \in \mathcal{P}(N)$, we execute the following.
\\[
  DP[j \cup k] \gets \min(DP[j \cup k], DP[j] + a).
\\]

## [F - Pure](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc142/tasks/abc142_f)

If $M = 0$, the answer is `-1`. Hereinafter we assume that $M \geq 1$.

### Observation

Suppose there exists an induced subgraph $G'$ of $G$ whose in-degree and out-degree of every vertex are both $1$. How is the structure of $G'$? We can easily see that it is a simple cycle and its disjoint union.

However, many algorithm that determines whether the graph has a cycle or not do not detect a simple cycle. If the answer is yes, they just tell us there is a cycle. In this problem, $O(N ^ 2 + M ^ 2)$-solution is allowed.

### My solution

We focus on the fact that the smallest cycle must be a simple cycle. We determine the smallest cycle by brute-force method.

Fix an edge $(A, B)$. We use **BFS** from $B$ to $A$ to search for the shortest path. If we find a cycle combining the path and the edge, this is a possibility of the smallest cycle. We execute this process for all $(A, B)$. The solution works in $O(M (N + M))$-time.
