# Solutions

## [A - Multiplication 1](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc169/tasks/abc169_a)

Just flush $A \times B$.

## [B - Multiplication 2](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc169/tasks/abc169_b)

### Solution

We must obey the rule "if the result exceeds $10 ^ {18}$, print `-1` instead", avoiding the overflow. Here is an easy way; casting `ll` into `long double` for us to multiply two integers without overflow.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">touristのコード見てたらoverflow避けがこんなに簡単にできるんですねと勉強になった。<br><br>if ((long double) d * (long double) x &lt; ret) {<br> ret = d * x;<br>}</p>&mdash; kjnh10 (@kjnh10) <a href="https://twitter.com/kjnh10/status/1264252018182418432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 23, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Thus, when we see the the result exceeds $10 ^ {18}$, we stop there, flush `-1` and exit. There occurs, however, a new problem here. If there exists such $i$ that $A _ i = 0$, the real result will be $0$ but by this algorithm we mistakenly flush `-1`. Thus before executing the multiplication, we check whether there exists $i$ so that $A _ i = 0$.

## [C - Multiplication 3](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc169/tasks/abc169_c)

This is a problem about truncation error.

We get the input by `ll a;` and `long double b;`. Then, we cast $100b$ into `ll c;` by `static_cast<ll>(floor(b * 100 + 0.5));`. Then, flush $ac / 100$.

## [D - Div Game](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc169/tasks/abc169_d)

Let $N = \prod _ i p _ i ^ {e _ i}$ be the prime factorization. The best way to choose $z$ is to try $z = e _ i ^ 1, e _ i ^ 2, \dots$ and so on to the extent that we can no longer divide the integer for all $i$. The answer is its sum.

## [E - Count Median](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc169/tasks/abc169_e)

### Solution

Let $M _ A$ and $M _ B$ be the median of $\\{ A _ i \\}$ and $\\{ B _ i \\}$ respectively. Then, the possible medians lies in $[M _ A, M _ B]$. We can arbitrarily choose each element in $[A _ i, B _ i]$. Thus, if $N$ is even, the median is available by $(1 / 2)$-based indentations; if $N$ is odd, the median is available as integers.

### Implementation

To avoid non-integers, if $N$ is odd, we double $A _ i$ and $B _ i$ in advance. Then, the answer is $M _ B - M _ A + 1$.

## [F - Knapsack for All Subsets](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc169/tasks/abc169_f)

### Solution

Let $T$ be the subset of $\\{ A _ i \\}$. Let $U \subset T$ be the set of $A _ i$ on which we consider the sum, i.e., $\sum _ {A _ i \in U} A _ i = S$.

Instead of fixing $T$ and then choosing elements for $U$, we decide whether the element $A _ i$ is included in $U$ and / or $U$ for each $i$. Then, this manipulation becomes choosing the following three possibilities for each $A _ i$.

1. $A _ i \in U \subset T$.
2. $A _ i \not \in U$ but $A _ i \in T$.
3. $A _ i \not \in T$.

Therefore, we can solve this problem by fixing a little the well-known ordinary $0/1$-knapsack problem.

### DP part

#### Definition

> $dp[i][j] = $ the possibilities where we work on $A[0, i)$ to generate $\sum _ {A _ k \in U} A _ k = j$.

#### Initial state

$dp[0][0] = 1$; otherwise $0$.

#### Answer

$dp[N][S]$.

#### Transition

For $i = 0, \dots, N - 1$, for $j = 0, \dots, S$, we execute the followings.
\\[
  \begin{align}
    dp[i + 1][j + A[i]] & \mathbin{ {+} {=} } dp[i][j] & & (j + A[i] \leq S), \\\\\
    dp[i + 1][j] & \mathbin{ {+} {=} } dp[i][j].
  \end{align}
\\]
Here the former line is corresponding to the case 1., and the latter line is to the cases 2. and 3.
