AC solutions with minus scores were regarded as just WAs. Thus, I made up my mind to get the minimum score, that is, 1.</p>&mdash; Kazune Takahashi (@kazune_lab) <a href="https://twitter.com/kazune_lab/status/1190635112192331776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">2019年11月2日</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="ja"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Then, I focused on the total score is just the sum of the 50 cases. The 47 cases were hidden, but fixed. I decided that I obtained minus scores on the other 49 cases which was totally roughly -50,000 points and then reach the plus score on the first case which was not hidden.</p>&mdash; Kazune Takahashi (@kazune_lab) <a href="https://twitter.com/kazune_lab/status/1190635117972049921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">2019年11月2日</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="ja"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Actually I succeeded in gaining the minus score, -55,791 points as the sum of the 49 cases then I found a solution for 58,212 points for the first example by a randomly way. Then I filled unneeded panels to lose my point down to 55,792 points. Thus the total score was 1.</p>&mdash; Kazune Takahashi (@kazune_lab) <a href="https://twitter.com/kazune_lab/status/1190635119217823744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">2019年11月2日</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
