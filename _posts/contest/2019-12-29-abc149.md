# Solutions

## [A - Strings](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc149/tasks/abc149_a)

Execute `cout << T << S << endl;`.

## [B - Greedy Takahashi](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc149/tasks/abc149_b)

Do as following, not to make silly mistakes.

```c++
  ll x{min(A, K)};
  A -= x;
  K -= x;
  ll y{min(B, K)};
  B -= y;
  K -= y;
```

## [C - Next Prime](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc149/tasks/abc149_c)

Use your library.

## [D - Prediction and Restriction](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc149/tasks/abc149_d)

The greedy algorithm works. We should win as many times as possible. If we skip the win of $i$-th duel when we can win, the reward after that will be at most $1$ winning, that is, that of the $i + K$-th duel. Thus we should win $i$-th duel.

## [E - Handshake](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc149/tasks/abc149_e)

### Solution

The binary search works. We sort $\\{ A _ i \\}$ in the descending order. Fix $X$ as the minimum score we gain by shaking hands. For $i = 0, \dots, N - 1$, we determine the maximum $j$ so that $A _ i + A _ j \geq X$. We sum up these $j$'s and we see whether this is less than or equal to $M$. Then we again apply the binary search for $X$.

### Caution Points

The answer is the sum of the scores greater than or equal to $X$ plus $X - 1$ to fill up to $M$.

Use `ll` for $N$ and $M$.

### Tips

We can use `partial_sum` as follows.

```c++
  vector<ll> V(N);
  for (auto i{0}; i < N; ++i)
  {
    cin >> V[i];
  }
  vector<ll> sum(N + 1); // + 1.
  partial_sum(V.begin(), V.end(), sum.begin() + 1); // + 1.
```

## [F - Surrounded Nodes](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc149/tasks/abc149_f)

### Observation

We calculate the sum of the holeyness instead of the expectation of it. It will be the sum of the holeyness of each vertex. Fix one vertex $v$. How many possibilities are there which cause $v$ to be a hole?

This is calculated as follows. We once regard $v$ as the root of $T$. Each subtree of the children of $v$ will be considered. The white-colored $v$ will be a hole if and only if all the subtrees contains at least one black vertex. This will be calculated as follows.
\\[
  2 ^ {N - 1} - 1 - \prod _ {w \in children[v]} \left( 2 ^ {cnt[w]} - 1 \right) \tag{F.1}
\\]

### Solution

We have to compute the sum of those in $O(N)$-time or so. This is done by tree-DP (or just DFS). The problem is that we cannot hold $children[v]$ unless $v$ is the root. But we can do the same manipulation. The missing "child" and its subtree is actually its parent and ancestors. We need its size, which we can compute by $N - 1 - \sum cnt[w]$. Then, (F.1) works.
