# Solutions

## [A - Can't Wait for Holiday](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc146/tasks/abc146_a)

Use `vector<string>`.

## [B - ROT N](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc146/tasks/abc146_b)

Use the following lambda function.

```c++
  auto adv = [&](char x) {
    int l{x - 'A'};
    int r{(l + N) % 26};
    return static_cast<char>('A' + r);
  };
```

Don't forget to cast `int` into `char`.

## [C - Buy an Integer](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc146/tasks/abc146_c)

The function $f(n) = An + B d _ n$ is an increasing function. Thus we use binary search.

## [D - Coloring Edges on Tree](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc146/tasks/abc146_d)

### Solution

The number of needed colors is **just the maximal degree of every vertex**. Therefore, we use DFS.

## [E - Rem of Sum is Num](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc146/tasks/abc146_e)

### Observation

We determine when $(i, j]$ is good. We use partial sum. We think of the following condition: $(S _ j - S _ i) \% K = j - i$. **This is not equivalent to $(S _ j - S _ i) \% K = (j - i) \% K$** but $(S _ j - S _ i) \% K = (j - i) \% K$ and $j - i < K$.

To simplify the equation, First we subtract each $A _ i$ by $1$. Then, the condition is $S _ j \% K - S _ i \%K = 0$ and $j - i < K$.

### Solution

Thus we can solve this problem by **two-pointers method**. We possess the distribution of $S _ i$ for the recent $K - 2$ elements. Use `map<ll, ll> M;`.

## [F - Sugoroku](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc146/tasks/abc146_f)

### DP part

First we reverse $S$. We go to $0$ from $i$. We can calculate

> $DP[i] = $ the minimum steps from $i$ to $0$

as follows.

#### Initial state

$DP[0] = 0$; otherwise $-1$.

#### Transition

For $i = 1, \dots, N$, if $S[i] = 1$, we set $DP[i] = \infty$. Otherwise,
\\[
  DP[i] = 1 + \min _ {1 \leq k \leq M} DP[i - k],
\\]
where out-of-range will be $\infty$. If we have $DP[i] > \infty$, flush `-1` to exit. This can be done by `multiset<int> I` in $O(\log M)$-time.

Don't forget to reverse $DP$.

Or, we can use segment tree.

### Solution

Suppose that we are now in $i$-th square. We can go to whatever square $j$ we like **as long as $j - i \leq M$ and $DP[j] = DP[i] + 1$**. To find the lexicographically smallest sequence, we choose the smallest $j$.

This is done in $O(N)$-time because the index we see is increasing.
