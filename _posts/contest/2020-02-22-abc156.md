# Solutions

## [A - Beginner](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc156/tasks/abc156_a)

Flush $R + 100(10 - \min(N, 10))$

## [B - Digits](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc156/tasks/abc156_b)

Use `while` loop.

## [C - Rally](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc156/tasks/abc156_c)

Try all $0 \leq X \leq 100$. Or we can try just two possibility as follows. We want to minimize
\\[
  f(X) = \sum _ {i \in N} (X _ i - X) ^ 2.
\\]
Note that $f$ is a quadratic function. If $X$ is real valued, the minimum is achieved at $X$ with $f'(X) = 0$, i.e.,
\\[
  X = \frac{1}{N} \sum _ {i \in N} X _ i.
\\]
Therefore, we try $X = \sum X _ i / N$ and $(\sum X _ i / N) + 1$ where `/` is computer's division.

## [D - Bouquet](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc156/tasks/abc156_d)

The answer is
\\[
  2 ^ N - 1 - \begin{pmatrix} N \\\ A \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} N \\\ B \end{pmatrix}.
\\]

Here, $N \leq 10 ^ 9$. We should use the following formula.
\\[
  \begin{pmatrix} N \\\ A \end{pmatrix} = \frac{N!}{A! (N - A)!} = \frac{N \cdot (N - 1) \cdot \dots \cdot (N - A + 1)}{1 \cdot 2 \cdot \dots \cdot A}
\\]
We can calculate the right hand side's denominator in $O(A)$.

## [E - Roaming](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc156/tasks/abc156_e)

If $K \geq N$, any distribution is possible. The answer is
\\[
  \begin{pmatrix} N + (N - 1) \\\ N - 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\\]

Hereinafter, we assume that $K < N$. Let $V$ be the array of the numbers of people in each room. First, we determine that we can make it for given $V$. Thanks to the condition $N \geq 3$ and $K \geq 2$, we can say that $V$ is possible if and only if **there are less than or equal to $K$ rooms where no people are present**.

Thus we fix the number of the empty rooms $x$. We choose $x$ rooms of $N$ rooms as the empty rooms. After that, we distribute $x$ people to $N - x$ rooms. Therefore, the answer is
\\[
  \sum _ {0 \leq x \leq K} \begin{pmatrix} N \\\ x \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x + N - x - 1 \\\ N - x - 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\\]

## [F - Modularness](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc156/tasks/abc156_f)

If we answer each query in $O(K)$, this problem is solved. That is, we generate the function `ll solve(ll n, ll x, ll m)`.

Let $e _ i = d _ i \% m$ and $x \gets x \% m$. We use $X, Y, Z$ to denote the followings.

> $X = $ the number of $0 \leq i \leq n - 1$ that satisfies $a _ i < a _ {i + 1}$, <br>
> $Y = $ the number of $0 \leq i \leq n - 1$ that satisfies $a _ i = a _ {i + 1}$, <br>
> $Z = $ the number of $0 \leq i \leq n - 1$ that satisfies $a _ i > a _ {i + 1}$.

Apparently, we see that $X + Y + Z = N - 1$. We want to calculate $X$, but instead of that, we count up $Y$ and $Z$.

We see that $Y$ is the number of $i$ which satisfies $e _ i = 0$. And we come up with a good idea that **we consider $Z$ as the number of carrying-up**. We don't need to determine where it occurs. To compute the count, we just divide $x$ plus the sum of $e _ i$ by $m$.

Both of these ideas are compatible to the period. Let $S = \sum _ {i \in k} e _ i$. Let $C$ be the number of $i \in k$ with $e _ i = 0$. Let $T = (n - 1) / k$ be the number of the reputation of rotation of $e$. Let $U = (n - 1) \% k$ be the the remainder. Let $A$ be $x$ plus the sum of $e _ i$. Then, we can compute as follows.
\\[
  \begin{align}
    A &= x + ST + \sum _ {i < U} e _ i, \\\\\
    Y &= CT + \sum _ {i < U} \delta _ {e _ i = 0}, \\\\\
    Z &= A / m.
  \end{align}
\\]
The answer is $X = n - 1 - Y - Z$.
