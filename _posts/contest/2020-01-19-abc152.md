# Solutions

## [A - AC or WA](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc152/tasks/abc152_a)

Flush `Yes` if $N = M$; otherwise `No`.

## [B - Comparing Strings](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc152/tasks/abc152_b)

Just do as they indicate us to. We can use the constructor of `std::string`.

```c++
int main()
{
  int a, b;
  cin >> a >> b;
  string s(b, '0' + a);
  string t(a, '0' + b);
  cout << min(s, t) << endl;
}
```

## [C - Low Elements](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc152/tasks/abc152_c)

We hold `int mini;` as the minimum value of the passed $P _ i$'s. We reset $mini \gets \min(mini, P[i])$. If $mini = A[i]$, we execute `ans++;`.

## [D - Handstand 2](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc152/tasks/abc152_d)

We define

> $C[i][j] = $ the number of the positive numbers less than or equal to $N$ which starts by $i$ and ends by $j$.

We can compute $C$ by running on $[1, N]$. The answer is
\\[
  \sum _ {i = 1} ^ 9 \sum _ {j = 1} ^ 9 C[i][j] C[j][i].
\\]

## [E - Flatten](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc152/tasks/abc152_e)

$X$ is a multiple of $A _ i$ for all $i$. Therefore $X$ is a multiple of the LCM of $A _ i$'s. Therefore the minimum is achieved when $X$ is LCM.

We can compute LCM directly by `cpp_int` or we can execute it by prime factorization.

## [F - Tree and Constraints](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc152/tasks/abc152_f)

This is a problem solved by inclusive-exclusive principle.

Let $m _ j$ be the condition satisfying that all the edges on the pass $(u _ j, v _ j)$ are white-colored. For $i \in 2 ^ N$, let $f(i)$ be the number of the coloring which satisfies all $m _ j$ for $j \in i$. Then, we see that $f(i) = 2 ^ {N - 1 - w _ i}$, where $w _ i$ is the number of the fixed white edges determined by the conditions $m _ j$.

Then, the answer is
\\[
  A = \sum _ {i \in 2 ^ M} (-1) ^ {\lvert i \rvert} f(i) = \sum _ {i \in 2 ^ M} (-1) ^ {\lvert i \rvert} 2 ^ {N - 1 - w _ i}.
\\]
Thus what we have to do is calculate $w _ i$ for each $i$. First we calculate the mask for $m _ j$ for each $j$ by DFS. Fix $i$. Then we merge these masks by bit operations. we can compute $w _ i$ by `popcount`. We also use it to calculate $(-1) ^ {\lvert i \rvert}$. To compute $2 ^ {N - 1 - w _ i}$, we just use `1 << (N - 1 - w);`.
