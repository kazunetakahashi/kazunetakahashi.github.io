# Solutions

## [A - Between Two Integers](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc061/tasks/abc061_a)

Determine if $A \leq C \land C \leq B$.

## [B - Counting Roads](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc061/tasks/abc061_b)

Do as they indicate us to.

## [C - Big Array](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc061/tasks/abc061_c)

Possess the integers by `vector<int> V(100010, 0);`. Then binary search works.

## [D - Score Attack](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc061/tasks/abc061_d)

Assume $0$-indexed. We possess the paths by `vector<Edge> V;` where `Edge` is a struct which has the source $a$, the destination $b$ and the cost $-c$. The shortest path is determined by Bellmanâ€“Ford's algorithm. Note that the shortest path consists at most $N - 1$ edges.

```c++
  vector<ll> D(N, infty);
  D[0] = 0;
  for (auto k = 0; k < N - 1; ++k)
  {
    for (auto i = 0; i < M; ++i)
    {
      ch_min(D[E[i].dst], D[E[i].src] + E[i].cost);
    }
  }
```

What we should do is **to separate the shortest path part and the loop determination part**. How can we determine the negative loop? In this problem, if both of the followings are satisfied, the answer is `inf`.

1. There exists a negative loop connected from $0$.
2. One of those are connected to $N - 1$.

We create `vector<bool> update(N, false);` and will update it.

For 1., we just execute the update once more. For 2., we execute $N - 1$ times more, too. If the condition 2. holds, `updated[N - 1]` will become `true` since the loop consists of at most $N$ edges. This enable us to distinguish `inf` and $D[N - 1]$.
